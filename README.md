After installing git and configuring your identity:

1. Create a directory.
2. Run git init to initialize it with a .git directory.
3. Create a .gitignore with touch .gitignore, and edit it with a file or directory to ignore. End the file with .DS_Store on the last line by itself
4. Create LICENSE.md and README.md files with echo '# README.md #' > README.md and echo '# LICENSE #' > LICENSE.md
5. Use git status to check which files are staged for commits.
6. Use git add to stage files to be committed.
7. Use git commit to commit changes to the repository, with the -m flag to include a message.
8. Use git log to see the commit history of the repo.
9. Use git diff to see what's changed in each file, line by line.
